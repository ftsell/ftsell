## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Finn Sell, also sometimes called ftsell. 
I'm a computer science student at the University of Hamburg, an activist, a hacker, a SysAdmin and sometimes all at once. 
My expertise and interests are System Administration and Automation, Networking (the computer kind) and creating fun applications for whatever seems useful. 
Additionally, I like learning things about privacy, security and how computers work from the ground up.

This GitHub profile only contains mirror reporitores though.
I'm actively working over at [git.ftsell.de](https://git.ftsell.de) or [git.hamburg.ccc.de/ftsell](https://git.hamburg.ccc.de/ftsell).
